This plugin was developed and used at Bigpoint but later neglected. By now, it is obsolete to us and not maintained anymore in any way.
Since there were request to look at this code, we decided to make it public.

Feel free to use it as inspiration but don't expect it to compile or to work with recent Jira versions.
We will not support or maintain this plugin in any way.
